## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

### Description
This program uses a dictionary to store student names and their corresponding marks and retrieves the marks based on user input.

### Functionality
- Creates a dictionary where:
  - **Keys** → Student names
  - **Values** → Student marks
- Accepts a student name from the user.
- Displays the marks if the student exists.
- Displays an appropriate message if the student name is not found.

### Sample Output

#### If the student exists:
Enter the Student name: neehar
neehar's Marks : 100

#### If the student does not exist:
Enter the Student name: rahul
Student not found

### Concepts Used
- Dictionaries
- Key-value pairs
- Exception handling (`KeyError`)
- User input and output

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

### Description
This program demonstrates **list slicing** and **reversing elements** in Python.

### Functionality
- Creates a list of numbers from **1 to 10**.
- Extracts the **first five elements** using slicing.
- Reverses the extracted elements.
- Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

### Sample Output
Extracted first five elements : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed Extracted elements : [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

### Concepts Used
- Lists
- List slicing
- List reversing
- Print formatting
